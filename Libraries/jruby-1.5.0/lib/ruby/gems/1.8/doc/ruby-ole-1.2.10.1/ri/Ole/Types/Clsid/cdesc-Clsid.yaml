    body: for VT_CLSID Unlike most of the other conversions, the Guid's are serialized/deserialized by actually doing nothing! (eg, _load &amp; _dump are null ops) Rather, its just a string with a different inspect string, and it includes a helper method for creating a Guid from that readable form (#format).
