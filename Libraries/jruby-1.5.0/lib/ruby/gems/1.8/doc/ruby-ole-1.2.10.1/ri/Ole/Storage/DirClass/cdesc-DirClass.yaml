  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: An <b>instance</b> of this class is supposed to provide similar methods to the class methods of Dir itself.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Fairly complete - like zip/zipfilesystem's implementation, i provide everything except chroot and glob. glob could be done with a glob to regex conversion, and then simply match in the entries array... although recursive glob complicates that somewhat.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Dir.chroot, Dir.glob, Dir.[], and Dir.tmpdir is the complete list of methods still missing.
