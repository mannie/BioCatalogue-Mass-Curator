  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Combined method for both horizontal and vertical alignment. Sets the first valid value (e.g. Format#align = :justify only sets the horizontal alignment. Use one of the aliases prefixed with :v if you need to disambiguate.)
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: This is essentially a backward-compatibility method and may be removed at some point in the future.
